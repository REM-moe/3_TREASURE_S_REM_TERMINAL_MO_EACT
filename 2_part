"You must be Detective Edward Teddy and you, Lieutenant Chuck.” He asked while we shook hands and introduced himself. “I am lieutenant Mills from local police.”

Accompanying us into the house, he said,
"As of now, we are clue less. The only suspicious thing we uncovered is the cypher texts, but our tech can’t decode that."

"Haven’t you people interrogated the neighbours, what’s their take on this, anything suspicious or promising?", I asked.

"We did it. Statements from first witness Linda, who is a maid here, neighbours Alex and David who reported the incident, were taken early morning. The man had a clean image, but the one thing most of them stated is Caecar’s envy with his elder brother Darren. We got nothing else from them."  

"Tell me about this elder brother scenario.", out of generic cop-instinct in enquired more.

"Darren is Caesar’s only blood brother. They used to live together in their family residence at Huston. There had been some conflict between them after death of their father that lead to a police case. This was about a decade and half ago, since then Caesar moved here. People don’t know the exact reasons, but they all said that the only person Caesar hates is Darren."

"Have you tried contacting him?", I asked.

"Yes, but he was not home. According to his wife, he is a social worker who goes on routine long trips and currently he is on one of such trips. We’ve sent for him."

"His routine trip seems suspicious. Isn’t it, Chuck?"

Chuck nodded in agreement.
As we reached the stairs, Mills turned to us and said,
"Superintendent is upstairs, waiting to meet you."

As we reached the second floor, the local police superintendent greeted us. He said,
"We are knocking every door but the assassin sealed most of them."

I understood his desperateness.
He led us to the crime room, where Caesar's life had been abruptly extinguished.

"In here," the superintendent said, opening the door to the bedroom.
“Caesar was found sitting on the chair. Lying down on the desk with a knife stuck to his back. No signs of struggle, no suspicious fingerprints, all dead ends. Everything in the room except for the computer is kept untouched, so feel free to take a look. Body has been sent for inquest, and can be looked over later. Take your time, Teddy. We're all in the dark here."
