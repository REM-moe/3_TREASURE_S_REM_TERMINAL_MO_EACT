The car rolled to a stop in front of Caesar's residence. Chuck and I exchanged glances before stepping out into the tense atmosphere.

As we approached the entrance, a figure emerged from the shadows. Marcus, Caesar's disciple and partner, stood with an air of grief that hung heavy around him. As we neared him, his eyes caught on our badges.

"Officers”, he said in a despite voice. “You've come about Caesar, I assume. I can’t take in what just happened. My heart can’t afford losing him. "

I offered my condolences, sensing the weight of Marcus's sorrow.
"We're here to uncover the truth, Marcus. Can you share anything that might help us understand what happened?"

He nodded, a mask of sadness veiling his eyes. " Caesar and I, our bond ran deep, more than just a disciple or a partner. Our research was ground-breaking, but lately, it seemed like shadows were closing in. We were on the brink of a breakthrough, but someone sought to extinguish that light."

“What is this ‘research’ about?”, Chuck asked in curiosity.

“Cyber ware, implant chips………… full on sci-fi stuff.”, he replied.

"Marcus, did Caesar mention anything unusual, anyone who might want to harm him?". I asked in curiosity.

“Nothing obvious, as far as I know. Except for some family drama, he was a clean man.”

As Marcus recounted their collaborations and the depth of their research, a young man in cop robes came to us in a hurry.
